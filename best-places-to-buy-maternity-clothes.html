With so many things to consider, from doctors to your diet, picking out clothing for your changing body doesn’t need to add to your anxiety.</p><p>Maternity clothes have come a long, long way since your grandmother sported her baby bump (then had to hide it under a voluminous tunic). Today, it’s easy to find a range of chic, comfortable, and high-quality maternity clothes to fit every style and season of your pregnancy, from the first trimester to postpartum.</p><p>Before you invest in multiple maternity pieces, you may find it helpful to keep this in mind as you start your search.</p><h3>Decide what you need</h3><p>Some people may only need maternity clothes in the second or third trimester. Some women shop their closets for oversized pieces or free-flowing skirts and dresses to wear through their pregnancy. Don’t try to squeeze yourself into your clothing though. It may be worth, at the very least, obtaining a few staple items through friends or retailers to make you more comfortable in your growing body. Maybe you need a dress for a special occasion or a few items for work, so decide what you need and shop accordingly.</p><h3>Make a budget</h3><p>If you are excited to shop for maternity clothes, decide what to spend. High-quality and fashionable maternity clothing can be expensive, just like non-maternity clothing. Sales, hand-me-down rentals, and second-hand shops like <a rel=nofollow href=#>ThredUp</a> are all ways to save. Buy items that grow with your changing body, like pants with expandable waistlines and stretchy leggings.</p><h3>Check your style</h3><p>Many of your favorite shops may also offer maternity lines. Don’t feel the need to stray from your personal style when you are pregnant. If you love wearing jeans, find a comfortable pair of maternity ones. If you want to keep up with fashion trends, you don’t have to sacrifice comfort for current designs. Find retailers that carry maternity collections that connect with you.</p><h3>Keep it comfortable</h3><p>Pregnancy hormones can disrupt sleep, skin, and even your sense of smell. Make sure any clothes you purchase feel good, and don’t be embarrassed to take a whiff of the item before you add it to your wardrobe. Retailers like Hatch take pride in producing comfortable and flattering clothing for expectant mothers.</p><h2 id=our-top-places-to-buy-maternity-clothes-online>Our top places to buy maternity clothes online</h2><h3>Best place to buy maternity work clothes: <a rel=nofollow href=#>Seraphine</a></h3><p>If you live in the U.K., you may already be familiar with Seraphine.

We also included larger stores to meet multiple price points and options for mothers of all ages and stages of pregnancy.</p><h2 id=frequently-asked-questions-faqs>Frequently asked questions (FAQs)</h2><h3>When do you start to wear maternity clothes?</h3><p>There is not one specific time when you start wearing maternity clothing. Some women opt out completely, depending on their style and budget. Many women start to wear maternity clothes when their clothing no longer comfortably fits, often in the second or even, for some, the third trimester.</p><h3>What size maternity clothes should I buy?</h3><p>Most maternity clothing designs follow the same non-maternity sizing, so if you typically wore a medium before pregnancy, you should start with a medium in maternity clothing, and so on. Trying maternity clothes on, just like any other piece of apparel, is a good idea to ensure a good fit.</p><h3>How many maternity clothes do I need?</h3><p>Most women who have gone through pregnancy recommend at least a few comfortable staples for work and home. If you plan to breastfeed, a few nursing shirts or dresses with front-opening snaps are practical.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmismaKyb6%2FOpmasoJ%2Blvaq6xmiYq6yZmLmme8Geqq1loKGupLHSZquoZZKqxm65wK2cq6aZqcZur8uoq6Gdo2Q%3D</p></div><div id=links><a href=./deconfinement-comment-assurer-la-circulation-des-pietons-en-toute-securite.html>&#171;&nbsp;comment assurer la circulation des pitons en toute scurit ?</a>
