The final candidates to be considered include the Democratic governors of Illinois, Minnesota, Pennsylvania and Kentucky along with Secretary of Transportation Pete Buttigieg and Arizona Senator Mark Kelly. If Harris wants to sustain the momentum of her campaign and give herself the best chance to win in November, we believe that Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro would make for the wisest choice.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">The Pennsylvania governor has a track record of pragmatic policymaking that has drawn favorability among groups that many thought impossible in today’s partisan environment, including Democrats and&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Republicans</a>,&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">business</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">labor unions</a>, and&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Muslims</a>&nbsp;and Jews. We believe comparing the pros to the cons would lead many voters, particularly those undecided voters, to cast their ballot for the Harris-Shapiro ticket.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">While Shapiro only took office in January 2023, he does bring nearly thirty years of political experience at <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">federal, state, and county levels</a>. Shapiro spent eight years on Capitol Hill, ultimately serving as <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">highly effective</a> chief of staff; six years as state attorney general and eight as a state representative, including a stint as <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">deputy speaker</a> of the House; and another <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">six years</a> on the Montgomery County Board of Commissioners, five of which he served as Chairman. Shapiro also gained <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">experience</a> as a corporate lawyer over more than a decade – balancing his part-time political roles as a state representative and county commissioner.</p><h2 class="text-2xl font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline">Encountering antisemitism</h2><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">In a last-ditch effort, far left groups attempted to sabotage Governor Shapiro’s candidacy using charged slurs, such as “Genocide Josh.” These <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">extremist groups</a> –seem to miss the fact that the governor is largely in line with the Biden-Harris Administration and “well within the mainstream of the Democratic Party,” as <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">noted</a> by Rep. Richie Torres (D, NY).</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">When Shapiro was 20 years old and attending the University of Rochester in New York, he <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">wrote an article</a> in which he said that Palestinians were "too battle-minded to be able to establish a peaceful homeland of their own." Shapiro had spent five months studying in Israel and volunteered in the Israeli army. When Shapiro was asked about his college article during <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">a news conference on Friday</a>, he highlighted that his views have since changed. “I have said for years, years before Oct. 7, that I favor a two-state solution—Israelis and Palestinians living peacefully side-by-side, being able to determine their own futures and their own destiny," he said.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Of course, those groups can always vote for a Trump-Vance presidency, with a former president who implemented an immigration and refugee&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">ban</a>&nbsp;on select Muslim-majority countries during his first term and who has openly&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">supported</a>&nbsp;Israel’s “war on terror.”</p><h2 class="text-2xl font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline">Sexual misconduct by a rogue staff member</h2><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">During recent political infighting, an allegation of sexual harassment was brought back up in public. The allegation was not against Shapiro but against a former staffer. The governor’s office <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">followed</a> a “rigorous process…grounded in integrity” conducting an internal investigation, reaching a settlement with the victim (but no admission of guilt), and resulting in the departure of the alleged offender. Non-disparagement is standard for such settlements across sectors; otherwise, there is no point in settling. Democrats would be wise to remember this was not misconduct by Shapiro and should keep the focus on Trump’s own sexual <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">misconduct</a>.</p><h2 class="text-2xl font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline">Long history of winning tough races</h2><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Governor Shapiro has seen success in elections that many deemed unwinnable. In his first political race in 2004, Shapiro won an open state House seat in an overwhelmingly Republican district, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">reportedly</a> knocking on more than 10,000 doors. In 2011, he was <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">elected</a> to the Montgomery County Board of Commissioners, the first time in the history of the county that the Democratic Party won control of the three-person Board. Finally, and most notably, Shapiro made <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">history</a> by winning more votes than any Pennsylvania governor ever and earning more votes than the Democratic presidential candidates in 2016 and 2020.</p><h2 class="text-2xl font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline">Highly popular among all voters</h2><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Maybe most importantly, the governor has the numbers to back up assertions that he could deliver Pennsylvania’s 19 electors to the Democrat Party in addition to other pivotal states in the “<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">blue wall</a>.” In May 2024, 57% of Pennsylvanians strongly or somewhat <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">approved</a> of Shapiro’s leadership – 35% of which were voters planning to back Trump in November.</p><h2 class="text-2xl font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline">Eloquent public speaker and campaigner</h2><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">While some may have forgotten the appeal and importance of a gifted orator after nearly eight years of Trump and Biden, voters must not forget the many of the memorable speeches delivered by President Barack Obama. Some commentators have <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">compared</a> Governor Shapiro’s speaking abilities to those of Obama, noting that they even sound alike. Executive oratory is not incidental but foundational as it is through such messaging that meaning is created. Presidential historian Richard Neustadt in his classic 1960 work <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Presidential Power</a> has explained that presidential power is not the coercive power to command but the subtle power to persuade. A president will be frustrated by merely barking orders. Getting things done in a democracy requires persuading others that acting consistency with the administration’s goals is in their own best interest. As <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">President Harry Truman warned</a> about his successor General Dwight (Ike) Eisenhower, “He'll sit here and he'll say, 'Do this! Do that!' And nothing will happen. Poor Ike—it won't be a bit like the Army.” The American people long for skilled speakers, who can connect with those of all backgrounds and reignite a declining sense of national pride.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Shapiro also took a slightly&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">different tactic</a>&nbsp;from his other short-listed peers during the intra-party contest to be vice president for a Harris presidency. Instead of appearing on&nbsp;cable news shows, the governor chose a more balanced approach, maintaining his regular travels as the state’s executive while staunchly campaigning for Harris and allowing his&nbsp;record to speak for itself. In effect, Shapiro showed Harris that he can be a loyal and effective number two – capturing enough attention to garner support for his cause but not stealing the spotlight.</p><h2 class="text-2xl font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline">A centrist, not an ideologue</h2><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Counter to the trends of our dominant two-party system of government, the governor does not always adhere to traditional party norms. While promising to protect state <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">voting</a> and <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">abortion</a> rights and advancing efforts in the state’s clean energy <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">transition</a>, Shapiro also chose not to <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">mandate</a> masks and vaccines for COVID-19 (but educate) and has advocated for the <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">adoption</a> of education savings accounts (but still has <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">teacher union</a> support), believing each policy best meet the needs of his diverse state.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">State leaders have&nbsp;commented on Shapiro’s pragmatic, centrist policymaking. For instance, the Republican member of the Montgomery County Board of Commissioners during Shapiro's tenure, praised Shapiro&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">stating</a>&nbsp;“[he was] the best county commissioner I ever knew.” During his gubernatorial bid in 2022,&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">seventeen</a>&nbsp;former GOP officials endorsed him over his GOP opponent, including former Congressman Charlie Dent and former U.S. Secretary of Homeland Security Michael Chertoff.</p><h2 class="text-2xl font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline">Pro-business and pro-growth agenda</h2><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">We have heard questions from countless CEOs inquiring what a potential Harris presidency means for the business environment. Shapiro should put any concerns of overly restrictive regulation or excessive tax policy to rest. Shapiro has been endorsed by <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">both</a> fossil fuel companies as well as environmental and renewable energy stakeholders. His more than ten years of experience <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">practicing</a> corporate law provides practical insights into the priorities of business leaders. In fact, he has advocated for <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">cutting</a> state corporate taxes in half as well as taken steps to <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">implement</a> business friendly policies, make government work at the speed of business, incentivize business innovation and expand pathways into the workforce. His administration has seen many successes in only 18 months, including <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">attracting</a> more than $2 billion in private capital investment and creating thousands of new jobs.</p><h2 class="text-2xl font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline">Character</h2><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Shapiro has been unafraid to engage in discussions about the <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">difficulties</a> embedded in the Israel-Hamas war and what it <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">means to him</a> as a person of Jewish faith. He has also shown a willingness to learn from past experience, admitting to rational but erroneous beliefs and refining policy positions, such as when he called for an end to all <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">capital punishment</a> once taking over the governor’s office. (Shapiro’s campaign platform in the 2016 state attorney general election made an exception for capital punishment for "heinous crimes.")</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Harris’s candidacy has breathed new life into the Democratic Party. A selection of Shapiro as a running mate would put her words of being a <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">unifier</a> into action. The vice president can often be an afterthought once votes are counted and presidents become engrossed in the demands of our nation’s most important job. However, some have used the vice presidency to be a true right-hand to the president, such as when <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Al Gore</a> led initiatives to rethink how government works or when then-Vice President <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Biden</a> implemented the $840 billion stimulus package in the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act. We believe Shapiro would be a true partner. With his pragmatic leadership style and consensus building experience, Shapiro has always delivered across a wide bipartisan constituency which will likely continue.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px"><strong>Correction, Aug. 3: </strong>The original version of this story misstated when Josh Shapiro took office.
