His son did farm chores, attended common school, grew tall and solid. Ambitious, he helped pay his way through Cornell College (Mt. Vernon, Iowa) which graduated him in 1898. He studied law at Iowa State University, hung out his shingle at the age of 26 in the town of Algona. Two years later he married Miss Myrtle Call who bore him a son, a daughter. For four years he was prosecuting attorney for Kossuth Co., spoke at Republican rallies, advanced to the Republican State Central Committee. Once he was defeated for the State Legislature. In 1918 he was elected to Congress where he has since served continuously.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">In Congress: In seniority of service he is the fourth ranking member of the Iowa delegation. So firmly entrenched is he, politically, in the soil of his district that no man has dared oppose him in primary or election for the last six years. He has risen to be chairman of the subcommittee of the House Appropriations Committee which handles all U.S. funds for Agriculture.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">In Congress he voted for the Soldier Bonus (1924), Farm Relief (1927, 1928, 1929), Immigration restriction (1924), Tax Reduction (1926, 1928, 1930), the Jones (heavier Prohibition penalties) Law (1929), Radio Control (1928).</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">He voted against Reapportionment (1929) Though not on formal record, he favored Boulder Dam (1928), opposed the Navy’s 15-cruiser bill (1929).</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">He votes Dry, drinks Dry, but does not make Prohibition speeches.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">To foreign affairs he gives scant attention, takes no side on the World Court, Disarmament, the League of Nations. His position is that the Senate, not the House, must deal with such matters.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Legislative hobby: Agriculture and Farm Relief.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">He is the real leader of the farm bloc in the House. This bloc is not so insurgent as its Senate counterpart, which permits him and his followers to maintain their standing as regular party men. He has stopped counting the number of bills for farm aid he has offered in the House in the past eleven years. Many of them were along the same lines the Federal Farm Board is now pursuing. With his knowledge of practical husbandry, of law, of politics, he has become Agriculture’s most potent House orator. He plugged for the old McNary-Haugen bill, extolled the Equalization Fee, favored the Debenture Export Plan. Though disagreeing with his agricultural views, President Coolidge once recommended him to a Massachusetts audience as the House’s “strongest speaker” on farm relief. He made his activities felt upon the House leadership. Speaker Longworth remarked: “Dick, if you ever need an affidavit that you have been a hell-raiser for agriculture, just call on me.”</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">In 1924, after two summers on a Chautauqua circuit as a farm relief speaker, he appeared at the Republican National Convention at Cleveland as a “dark horse” candidate for the Vice-Presidency.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">In appearance he is handsome, in manner friendly, affable. Above broad shoulders, he carries high a well-shaped head with a shock of white hair combed back into a pompadour. Smooth-shaven, his Roman features have been burned dark by Iowa sunshine. A quick engaging smile reveals gleaming white teeth. Not at all the hayseed type of legislator, he wears conservatively cut grey sack suits, feels no embarrassment in cutaway and silk hat.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">He does not smoke or chew. When angered, he swears vigorously. His flashy temper quickly subsides. Once he taught Sunday school in Algona. A Congregationalist, he used to attend the same church as President Coolidge until the crowds drove him away.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">No sportsman, he plays anagrams with all-comers at any time, cribbage and bridge occasionally. He drives a Peerless and a Dodge, fiddles with his radio for distant stations, enjoys cinema. He lives in an apartment at No. 2800 Ontario Road in Washington, entertains the required amount for a Congressman, no more. His married son is his House secretary. His hobby: Dickinson genealogy.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">As a candidate for the Senate, to succeed Democratic Senator Daniel Frederic Steck, he has already opened his primary campaign for the Republican nomination against Iowa’s Governor John Hammill.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Impartial House observers rate him thus: An able and industrious legislator who has supplied the House farm bloc with its political motive power. He stands higher than his slower-witted Iowa colleague, Chairman Gilbert N. Haugen of the House Committee on Agriculture. Except on controversial farm relief questions, his votes are with the regular Republican majority whose leaders frequently seek his advice. He supports the efforts of the Federal Farm Board through its experimental period. He is one of the 15 most potent members of the House, one of the 15 most popular.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">His House term expires March 3, 1931.—ED.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Louisiana’s Sessums Sirs:</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Clerical Louisiana must feel much slighted at your failure to record in Milestones the death on Christmas Eve of the Right Reverend Davis Sessums, bishop of the Episcopal diocese of Louisiana.

The fact that he made such good time with his peculiar gate gave him very little desire to walk, and accordingly his learning to travel in an upright position was postponed for some time.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">V.
