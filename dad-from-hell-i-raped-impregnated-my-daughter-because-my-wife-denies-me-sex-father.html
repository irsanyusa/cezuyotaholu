None of us knew anything about the incident until he was arrested. The only thing we saw was that the man beat up his wife and daughter late in the night on Tuesday.</p><p>The girl was pregnant and the father tried to hide it. It was her school that informed the Lagos State Government.</p><p>The girl confessed that it was her father who raped and impregnated her. The Lagos State Ministry of Youth and Social Development alerted the police and the man was arrested.</p><p>The suspect did not deny that he impregnated the girl. He knew the government was involved and he had no hiding place. We learnt he told the police that his wife did not allow him to have sex with her and he yielded to the temptation of raping his daughter.</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>The girl’s mother told her family members, who then went to her school. They did not know the school authorities would get the ministry involved. The matter was also reported to some child rights workers in the Oshodi area.”</p><p>However, it was gathered that the girl's mother had procured an abortion for the teenager before the police could move in and arrest the randy father, leading to her arrest as well for involvement in the alleged abortion.</p><p>The Coordinator, Domestic and Sexual Violence Response Team in the state,<strong> Lola Vivour-Adeniyi</strong>, said the victim was safe in government’s custody.</p><p>“Social workers have rescued the victim. She is now at an orphanage provided by the state government. We have also called for the duplicate case file.</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>The girl’s mother was arrested for allegedly aborting the pregnancy. The police may grant her bail on the grounds that she has a four-year-old boy.”</p><p>The State Police Public Relations Officer (PPRO),<strong> SP Dolapo Badmos</strong>, confirmed the incident, adding that investigation was ongoing.</p><p>“The man raped and impregnated his daughter, while the mother also procured abortion for her.</p><p>The Commissioner of Police, , has ordered that the case be transferred to the gender unit of the command for investigation. The girl is placed in a shelter because we cannot afford to see her go back to that vicinity.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7scHLrJxnppdktKq%2F02ibmpxdm7%2BwuYyhnKWkXZ56s63PnptmoZ2lv6azzZqrnpxdosZusMCunqGslad6o7HCmqysnV2ixm7DyJ%2BcZpyVo7amv4ymnGarla16p63ToZyrZ52dureCj6U%3D</p></div><div id=links><a href=./26-exclusive-things-from-japan-the-world-would-like-to-adopt-648110.html>&#171;&nbsp;26Exclusive Things From Japan the World Would Like toAdopt</a>
