are searching to learn from his marriage and shouldn't make money topmost priority when choosing a man to spend the rest of their lives with.</p><p>Narrating his marital journey, he showered sweet words on his wife, saying that if not for his wife, he probably wouldn’t have been where he is today or his very popular drama ministry.</p><p>Bamiloye narrated how his wife's family had protested against their relationship including how his elder sister who had gone to his wife's family and pleaded with them not to give her brother their daughter's hand in marriage because he was jobless and poor.</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p><strong>Read his story below:</strong></p><p>(Tribute to My Wife – Sister Gloria Bamiloye)</p><p>Proverbs 31:10-12, 23, 28, 30 NKJV</p><p>[10] Who can find a virtuous wife? For her worth is far above rubies.</p><p>[11] The heart of her husband safely trusts her; So he will have no lack of gain.</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>[12] She does him good and not evil All the days of her life.</p><p>[23] Her husband is known in the gates, When he sits among the elders of the land.</p><p>[28] Her children rise up and call her blessed; Her husband also, and he praises her:</p><p>[30] Charm is deceitful and beauty is passing, But a woman who fears the LORD, she shall be praised.</p><p>February 4th, 2015, was my wife’s 51st Birthday. And this year would be the 27 years, since 1988 the year we got married, when she was only 24 years old and I was 28. Since then, we have travelled through the thicks and the things together, we have climbed the mountains and descended into the valleys together. We have faced adverse physical and spiritual situations together. We have both confronted together, daunting challenges that have stood and those that are still standing against our lives and ministry.</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>She was 51 and she got phone calls and congratulatory text messages on phone and on Facebook page throughout yesterday till late in the night. Our two sons brought her gift – two digitally painted pictures of her early years on film set. And I also bought her a small teddy bear. The several phone calls and congratulatory messages of the birthday made us feel a large crowd of well-wishers had attended our birthday party. Thank you all.</p><p>But what is special about this great woman is when I remember how we started and how we have been journeying this journey since then. And when I recall some of the things that happen today among our single and marriageable sisters, I cannot but give praises to the Lord God who brought this simple and humble sister my way several years ago.</p><p>I have written this story in some of my write-ups and in one of my books, however, there is need to recall some of it for the benefit of some of our single sisters who might need to learn from it. I graduated from higher institution in 1983 and served in 1983/84. Right from the Campus days, I had been involved in drama ministry, all through my Youth Service, I was sending drama scripts back into the fellowship for drama presentations and I would travel down from Plateau State to direct the rehearsals and participate in the major drama presentation on Drama Night. After my Youth Service in 1984, I was involved fully in campus drama evangelism with the fellowship drama group, travelling to other campuses and churches outside the campus for drama presentation. And Sister Gloria was among the new members that joined the drama group.</p><p>In 1985, sometimes in early July, I proposed to her to marry me and she told me she would pray over it. On August 4th, 1985, she revisited my proposal and said “Yes” to it. So, our journey began. Now, the real issue was that, I had nothing. I had nothing physical or material that any lady could be proud of. I had only one single room, with one bed, one table and chair, a standing hanger where I hanged my few fading shirts and only one suit which I used to iron from time to time and red tie from special occasion.</p><p>Inside the single room was my cooking stove and a dilapidated standing fan, which had lost its foot and the head was tied facing the bed. And of course, a precious item – my bookshelf serving as a small library.</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>So, when Sister Gloria visited my abode for the first time, these were all I had and she saw. My physical and material possessions could never be compared to what I was on the campus. “Bro Mike” was famous among the fellowship as a “gym-gym” brother full of zeal for drama and drama only.</p><p>And the drama group of the fellowship became the most influential of all the sub-groups of the fellowship, because almost all the executive officers became members of the sub-group, including the President and the Vice-President and the General Secretary of the Christian Fellowship. So I was so rich in spiritual substance and full of great visons, but had no enviable physical or material possessions any young lady could be proud of.But, when Sis Gloria entered my room, one afternoon, she never saw all those things I mentioned but only one thing arrested her attention: my bookshelf containing several spiritual books, including the books of Kenneth Hagin's, Oral Roberts, T.L. Osborne, Oswald J. Smith, etc. She hasten to the shelf and shouted “Whoa!”, and she sat by the bookshelf and began to look at those precious books she had longed to have and read. Ah!.</p><p>I was happy I had what she wanted and desired. She wanted spiritual books that would make her grow. And I had just that! All other things never mattered to her.I had nothing physical, but I had a great vision of the future and she embraced that vision with all her heart and might. When her senior brothers and her parents were demanding from her to know the work that her fiancee was doing that could qualify him to marry her, she stood on my behalf to defend me before her people that I was into drama ministry and there was a great future ahead of us.</p><p>The people could not see what she was talking about, because I was already on full-time drama ministry and I had no physical enviable thing they all could hold on to. They were furious with her and thought she must be out of her mind to have decided to marry “a man who has no job and no physical possession and no appreciable future”.</p><p>When we informed them we wanted to get married three years down our courtship, they revolted and my Mummy ( my elder sister), led the war to Sis Gloria’s parents to warn them never to give their daughter to me in marriage because I had no job to take care of their daughter. She stood by what God had told her about me, that there was a great future ahead of us. The Lord convinced them all and they supported us and we married in 1988, three years after the Mount Zion ministry launched. And our journey to that future began.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7scHLrJxnppdksLC5zK6loqyZmsBwvsSloKChn6N8psLAp56epJmowW65yKScZpqRoratu9ieZKaxXai2tMDEq2Stp5yZeq7FjLCgn52jYrOiucilsGasmJrGbr%2FHqKylnJ6peqKvwp6nrWWdmnqiv46yaJ6oYayw</p></div><div id=links><a href=./400000-recrutements-abandonnes-chaque-annee-faute-de-candidats.html>&#171;&nbsp;400.000 recrutements abandonns chaque anne faute de candidats</a>
