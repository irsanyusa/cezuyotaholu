He&nbsp;and his wife, 44, have been married for 20&nbsp;happy years. The man told his story, pointing out that he&nbsp;and his then wife-to-be started dating in&nbsp;<a href=# title="high school" data-link=tag>high school</a> when he&nbsp;was a&nbsp;junior, and she was a&nbsp;senior. They were long distance for his wife’s first two years of&nbsp;<a href=# title=college data-link=tag>college</a> while he&nbsp;was in&nbsp;high school.</p><p>They both studied one year at&nbsp;community college, then they went to&nbsp;college in&nbsp;the same city for a&nbsp;year. Since that time, they have lived together. The couple got married the summer after the man graduated from college. Their marriage has been pretty great so&nbsp;far for both spouses, at&nbsp;least the man thought&nbsp;so. Recently, he&nbsp;decided to&nbsp;start a&nbsp;<a href=# title=divorce data-link=tag>divorce</a> process, because he&nbsp;had discovered that his wife was unfaithful to&nbsp;him with multiple other men, and the period of&nbsp;time when it&nbsp;happened, was the most painful revelation for the man.</p><p><h2>The awful secret was revealed during an&nbsp;ordinary dinner with friends.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/eab/798/be882c5529b396e4d7f9f4b3be.jpg><p>One day, right after Christmas, the spouses <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>decided</a> to&nbsp;get together with a&nbsp;few friends of&nbsp;the man’s wife, who had known her since they were in&nbsp;the college. They all intended to&nbsp;catch&nbsp;up, have dinner, and hang out. In&nbsp;the company of&nbsp;each other, they talked about a&nbsp;lot of&nbsp;stuff, and the man’s wife mentioned that they met in&nbsp;high school. Her old college roommate commented that it&nbsp;was crazy that they met in&nbsp;high school, had a&nbsp;few wild years in&nbsp;college, then ended up&nbsp;together. The man played along and commented that he&nbsp;didn’t know if&nbsp;his wife was as&nbsp;crazy as&nbsp;he&nbsp;was.</p><p>The roommate started to&nbsp;tell a&nbsp;story, but the man’s wife suddenly cut her off and said she was uncomfortable about&nbsp;it. The man wrote that he&nbsp;sensed something was&nbsp;up, so&nbsp;he&nbsp;said that they actually started dating in&nbsp;high school and were together for his wife’s entire time at&nbsp;college. All of&nbsp;his wife’s friends got real quiet and the rest of&nbsp;the dinner was awkward. On&nbsp;the way out, one of&nbsp;her other roommates took the man aside and said he&nbsp;should have “an&nbsp;honest conversation” about what happened at&nbsp;college.</p><p><h2>The man cannot come to&nbsp;terms with the recent revelation.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/d81/1fa/a8f9f353a3a8b0ef68e9dc622b.jpg><p>He&nbsp;asked his wife on&nbsp;the way home, and she made him totally <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>shocked</a>. She said that the details of&nbsp;their college lives weren’t important. When the spouses got home, the man told his wife that he&nbsp;was going to&nbsp;stay at&nbsp;his brother’s house until she was ready to&nbsp;talk about what happened in&nbsp;college.</p><p>The next day, the woman came over and admitted to&nbsp;cheating on&nbsp;her husband with “several” men during her first two years at&nbsp;college. She said she didn’t consider it&nbsp;a&nbsp;big deal at&nbsp;the time because they were long distance, and she didn’t think a&nbsp;high school romance would last. The man pressed for more details, and she said it&nbsp;was at&nbsp;least 10&nbsp;different men, including at&nbsp;least 3&nbsp;guys she introduced to&nbsp;him as&nbsp;friends when he&nbsp;came to&nbsp;visit on&nbsp;weekends and 1&nbsp;guy she was still in&nbsp;contact with. The man immediately decided to&nbsp;file for divorce and intended to&nbsp;start the paperwork as&nbsp;soon as&nbsp;he&nbsp;could.</p><p>Many people now are telling him that he&nbsp;shouldn’t throw away his marriage over a&nbsp;few mistakes. But the man is&nbsp;convinced that cheating on&nbsp;him with multiple men for years is&nbsp;unacceptable, no&nbsp;matter when it&nbsp;happened. And the fact that she continued to&nbsp;maintain <a href=# title=relationships data-link=tag>relationships</a> with these guys right in&nbsp;front of&nbsp;him was an&nbsp;intolerable amount of&nbsp;disrespect. The couple have two children, but they are 17&nbsp;and 19&nbsp;and the man is&nbsp;sure the kids will understand why he&nbsp;needs to&nbsp;end the marriage.</p><p>And here’s yet another <a href=#>complex life story</a> of&nbsp;a&nbsp;man who accidentally found out that 5&nbsp;out of&nbsp;6&nbsp;kids that he&nbsp;had, weren’t his. And the decision he’s made may seem really tough for many people.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiaop60qcDSopueZp2afKK%2B06KapZ2jZK5uucCnZJ6mlKh6c3yMspyaql2irrO%2ByJqenmWRm8GmvoyhoKxlp56zpr%2BMrJycqpWpeqq%2FjKucr52RobKlecOuqaKml2KubrDIp6Weql1tfnh9lnBm</p></div><div id=links><a href=./babies-dogs-tug-of-war-video.html>&#171;&nbsp;Babies and Dogs Playing Tug of War: Video</a>
